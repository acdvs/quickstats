## Features
A simple input and output configuration box allows data to be in many different formats.

**Value separators**  
Like delimiters in CSV files, separators can be any string of characters that might separate each value of the input data.

**Show NaN warning**  
When checked, the input field displays a warning telling you that there is one or more non-number values in the input data.

**Increasing/decreasing output**  
All output is sorted automatically after each value entry and can be reversed with this option.

**Decimal places**  
Rounds and/or truncates all results to the specified precision. Results can be rounded to the nearest whole number and also not rounded at all.
